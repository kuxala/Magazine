            You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - 
            and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that 
            the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting 
            than going out there and being among the stars.

              <p>
                Starship, a marvel of engineering, embarked on an odyssey across the cosmic ocean, bridging the gap between Earth and Mars. 
                With its sleek stainless-steel exterior glinting in the cosmic sunlight, the vessel navigated the vast expanse of space, 
                a symbol of human determination and technological prowess. The journey among the stars
                 was both a triumph of innovation and a testament to the collective spirit that propelled humanity beyond the confines of Earth.

              <h4 class="list-subtitle">2028 - First Colony</h4>
              <p>In the year 2028, a diverse group of visionaries, scientists, and adventurers embarked on an 
                unprecedented journey to Mars. Their mission: to establish the first human colony on the Red Planet. Named Project Olympus,
                after the largest volcano in the solar system, the colony aimed to redefine the possibilities of human habitation beyond Earth.</p>

              <p>
                So, when we landed on Mars, it was time to build our homes. Think of it like building with big, cool Lego blocks. 
                Teamwork and some helper robots made it possible. Now, Crimson Horizon is like a small neighborhood right on Mars!

              <p>
                We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                Node School.

              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>
                We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was
                the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
